[A transfer learning approach based on random forest with application to breast cancer prediction in underrepresented populations.](https://psb.stanford.edu/callfor/papers/psb23_papers_allv2.pdf)  <br />
*Proceedings of Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing* <br />
Gu T, **Han Y**, Duan R(2022) <br />
We propose a transfer learning framework based on random forest models (TransRF). Our method incorporate risk prediction models trained in a source population to improve the prediction performance in a target underrepresented population with limited sample size.


[Robust angle-based transfer learning in high dimensions.](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12759) <br />
*ArXiv* <br />
Gu T, **Han Y**, Duan R(2022) <br />
We propose a novel flexible angle-based transfer learning (angleTL) method, which leverages the concordance between the source and the target model parameters. <br />

## Projects
---
**Mix-GWAS Polygenic Scores Estimation Method** <br />
Advisor: Professor Rui Duan, Department of Biostatistics, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health <br />
Sep.2022 - Now <br />
- Proposed a ranking-based polygenic scores ensemble method, and generated PRSs using multiple summary statistics and PRS estimation method (LDpred, PRSCS, SDPR, Sbayes, Lassosum)

**Transfer Learning Methods in Leveraging Sources to Improve Presicion Health** <br />
Advisor: Professor Rui Duan, Department of Biostatistics, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health <br />
May.2022 - Now <br />
- Proposed a random forest-based TL framework targeting risk prediction and improved AUC substantially.
- Designed an angle-based transfer learning framework and conducted cross-validation to select tuning parameters.
- Reproduced existing DNN and CNN transfer learning algorithms with Pytorch to biomedical data.

**How does mask mandate effect online learning? From a regression discontinuity perspective.** <br />
Advisor: Professor Yang Ning, Department of Statistics and Data Science, Cornell University <br /> 
Feb.2022 - May.2022 <br />
- Constructed a regression discontinuity framework including sharp regression with discontinuity design and constant
treatment effect model and discovered negative treatment effects on the face mask mandate had on online learning.
- Evaluated the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on education inequity by comparing the effects of face masks across
school districts varying in percentage of minorities and per pupil total expenditure.

**Selecting Hyper-parameters for Options Pricing Model** <br />
Advisor: Professor Yingda Song, Financial Engineering Research Center, SJTU <br />
Jun.2021 - Mar.2022 <br />
- Conducted simulations on five continuous Markov chain grids in the pricing of European double barrier options.
- Analyzed the applicability and features of these grid design methods under the choice of underlying asset model.
- Designed adaptive grids by iterating continuous Markov chain to simulate strike prices at expiration using Monte Carlo.

**Multi-factor Stock Selection Model Based on Regression Model** <br />
Advisor: Dr. Chenru Liu, Management Science and Engineering, Stanford University <br />
Jan. 2021 - Apr. 2021 <br />
- Preprocessed stock data to construct market and financial indicators and validate factors using single-factor analysis.
- Performed PCA tests to select factors and reduce multicollinearity.
