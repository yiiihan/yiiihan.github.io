Hi, welcome to my homepage!

I am a first-year PhD student in the [Department of Statistics at UC Berkeley](https://statistics.berkeley.edu). Previously, I majored in mathematics and statistics in Peking University, where I spent four great years in Yuanpei College and was very fortunate to be advised by Professor [Song Xi Chen](https://www.songxichen.com). Besides, I also had the pleasure of being a research assistant with Professor [Zheng Tracy Ke](http://zke.fas.harvard.edu) from Harvard University during the summer of 2020. 

 My undergraduate research mainly focused on applied projects related to air pollution and COVID-19. There we develop and use statistical methods to evaluate air pollution in China, and help with the evaluation and prediction of the global pandemic (see my [publications](https://imyaxuan.github.io/publications/) for details). 

Feel free to contact me if you would like to connect!
