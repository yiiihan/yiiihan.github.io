Hi, welcome to my homepage!

I am a senior in [School of Mathematics](https://math.sjtu.edu.cn), Shanghai Jiao Tong University(SJTU), China. In 2022 fall, I am a visiting student in Dpartment of Biostatistics, Harvard T.H.Chan School of Public Health, adivised by Professor [Rui Duan](https://sites.google.com/view/ruiduan/). Previously in 2022 Spring, I was an exchange student in Statistics and Data Science Department in Cornell University. I had the pleasure of doing an independent project supervised by Professor [Yang Ning](https://yangning.stat.cornell.edu) about regression discontinuity.

My research mainly lies in developing novel statistical and machine learning methods to study different types of large-scale real-world data to improve decision making in ublic health. Specifically, my academic interests include transfer learning and federated learning methods in presicion health. I am also interested in stochastic process and its application in financial engineering.

I enjoy hiking, camping, and playing badminton (epsecially playing doubles with my friends).

Feel free to contact me if you would like to connect!
