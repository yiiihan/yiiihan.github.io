Hi, welcome to my homepage!

I am a senior at the [School of Mathematics](https://math.sjtu.edu.cn), Shanghai Jiao Tong University(SJTU), China. Currently, I am a visiting student in Dpartment of Biostatistics, Harvard T.H.Chan School of Public Health and fortunate to work with Professor [Rui Duan](https://sites.google.com/view/ruiduan/) as a research assistant. In 2022 Spring, I was an exchange student at Cornell University, advised by Professor [Yang Ning](https://yangning.stat.cornell.edu).

My research mainly lies in developing novel statistical and machine learning methods to study different types of large-scale real-world data to improve decision making. Specifically, my interest includes transfer learning that leverages external heterogeneous data sources to improve model performance with limited samples and federated learning that incorporates unidentified summary data to avoid privacy problems and communication inefficiency. 

I enjoy hiking, camping, and playing badminton (epsecially playing doubles with my friends).

Feel free to contact me if you would like to connect!
