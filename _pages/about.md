Hi, welcome to my homepage!

I am a senior in School of Mathematics in Shanghai Jiao Tong University(SJTU), China. Currently, i work as a research assistant in Professor [Rui Duan](https://sites.google.com/view/ruiduan/)'s group in Harvard T.H.Chan School of Public Health in Boston. 

Previously in 2022 Spring, I was an exchange student in Statistics and Data Science Department in Cornell University. I had the pleasure of doing an independent project supervised by Professor [Yang Ning](https://yangning.stat.cornell.edu) about regression discontinuity.

My research interest lies mainly in developing statistical and machine learning methods to study different types of large-scale real-world data such as biomedical datasets. I am also interested in stochastic process and its application in financial engineering.

Feel free to contact me if you would like to connect!
